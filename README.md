Accessible 2D Platformer


Super Giorgio is a 2D platformer game that is designed to be accessible to people with movement-related disabilities.
The purpose of the game is to bring the joys of playing video games to people who normally wouldnâ€™t be able to play them.
The game uses only one degree of freedom, which is jumping.   The player automatically moves from left to right and must
avoid obstacles and enemies that impede his or her path to the flag, which moves the player to the next level.  The player
also wants to collect as many coins as possible.

The source code is located in the "Assets" and "Project settings" folders.

The game can be played as an executable by downloading the Game Beta_Data and Game Beta.exe files.
